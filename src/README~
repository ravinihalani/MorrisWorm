The program implements Morris wormâ€™s host discovery functionality.
The program outputs a list of all host names known and possibly trusted by the current host.

The implementation can be run by just running the ./discovery command line interface as a single executable.

The code has been developed in Java in the MorrisMain.java file.
The program looks for hosts in the following locations:
--> /etc/hosts
--> ~/.ssh/config for each user and /etc/ssh/ssh_config. Note that you only need to extract hosts from the Host and HostName parameters
--> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys for each user
--> ~/.ssh/known_hosts for each user and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

Brief summary of the how the above requirement has been achieved in the program:

> From the /etc/hosts file we just retreive multiple hostnames listed in front of the IP addresses. Note that the addresses can be IPv4 / IPv6 both.
> From the the config and ssh_config file, we hunt for hostnames in front of the HostName and Host parameter
> Hostnames are retreived from the authorized_keys file using various parameters like permitopen,from,etc.
> The hostnames in the known_hosts file have been seperated by , and also can be individually placed.

The hostnames are the ones that are placed after '@' symbol in the files.Also, ! can be ignored and similarly *. can be ignored.

Note IP addresses are never printed in the output and that while looking for the above files, if a file is not found in the respective directory, we just handle it in try catch block and move to next available file.
